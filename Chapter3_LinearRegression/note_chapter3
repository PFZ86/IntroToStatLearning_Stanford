Advertising data: 
(1) sales ~ $1000s spent on three types of advertisement (tv, radio, newspaper)
(2) sales ~ newspaper: beta of newspaper is significant
	  sales ~ tv + radio + newspaper: beta of newspaper is not significant 
    (this is likely because corr(radio, newspaper)=0.35, the effect of newspaper is soaked into radio)

The standard error of an estimator reflects how the estimator varies under repeated samples.
se(\hat{slope})^2 = \frac{\sigma^2}{\sum_{i=1}{n} (x_{i}-\bar{x})^2}: 
(1) large \sigma^2 gives more variable estimate of slope.
(2) observations x_{i} are less spread out, the estimate of slope is more variable.

Some questions to ask in multiple regression:
(1) Is at least one predictor useful ? F-statistics
(2) Which subset of predictors are important ? forward selection; backward selection
(3) How to deal with qualitative variables (categorical variables, "factors") with K levels ? create (K-1) dummy variables 
and the level without dummy variable is called the baseline level. And the choice of the baseline level does not affect 
the fit of the linear regression model.

Interactions of predictors
(1) \hat{sales} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}*TV + \beta_{2}*radio: the average effect on sales of an one-unit increase in TV is 
always \beta_{1}, independent of the amount spent on radio.
The synergy effect in marketing: spending money on radio advertisement will increase the effectiveness of TV advertisement.
The interaction effect in statistics: the slope for TV should increase as radio increases.

(2) Hierarchy principle: if we include an interaction in a model, we should also include the main effects, 
even if the p-values of the main effects' coefficients are not significant.

(3.1) quantitative vs quantitative
\hat{sales} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}*TV + \beta_{2}*radio + \beta_{3}*TV*radio

(3.2) quantitative vs qualitative
\hat{balance} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}*income + \beta_{2}*isStudent + \beta_{3}*income*isStudent
\hat{balance} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}*income for non-student
\hat{balance} = (\beta_{0} + \beta_{2}) + (\beta_{1} + \beta_{3})*income for student
